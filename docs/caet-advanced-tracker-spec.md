# CAET Advanced Tracking Tool — Product Spec
## Status: POC COMPLETE → BUILD PHASE
## Owner: Dennis | Updated: 2026-02-18

## Certification Path (REVISED — Committee Feb 18)

**⚠️ Phase reorder proposed by Dennis Falasco, general committee agreement. Pending formal vote at convention.**

| Phase | What | How | Where |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| **1. Practical (PQS)** | Complete all practical tasks across 8 categories | Shop evaluator sign-off OR AEA class completion | At shop, AEA HQ, regionals, OEM training |
| **2. Written Exam** | Pass CAET Advanced written test (170-question bank) | USI proctored exam | USI testing centers |
| **3. Oral Board** | Portfolio review + technical questioning | 2 AEA committee members, Zoom, ~1 hour | Virtual (Zoom) |
| **🏆 Certified** | CAET Advanced → feeds into CAET Pro pipeline | | |

### Rationale for Reorder
Dennis Falasco: "Why have the book smarts if you can't apply it?" Complete practical first → proves you can do the work → then validate knowledge with written → oral board catches pencil-whipping and confirms everything.

## Four User Roles

| Role | What They Do | Key Views |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Technician/Apprentice** | Works through PQS tasks, studies for written, submits portfolio | Progress dashboard, task checklist, evidence uploads, study guide |
| **Shop Evaluator** | Signs off PQS tasks after train-the-trainer certification | Candidate roster, task sign-off interface, progress overview |
| **AEA Committee Member** | Conducts oral board (2 members per candidate), rubric-based scoring | Oral board queue, rubric scoring, candidate portfolio review |
| **AEA Admin** | Tracks all candidates nationally, manages evaluator qualifications, pipeline reporting | National dashboard, pipeline analytics, evaluator registry, recertification |

## Practical Skills Framework (8 Categories, from committee meeting)

### 1. Pitot-Static
- Connect pitot-static test equipment
- Perform pitot-static operational check
- Test altimeter (required inspection points)
- *(Pitot heat NOT included per Nick — AEA doesn't cover that in class)*

### 2. Surveillance Systems
- Perform 91.413 transponder test
- Verify ADS-B Out compliance
- Troubleshoot fail annunciations

### 3. Autopilot
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

### 4. FMS (Flight Management Systems)
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

### 5. Audio & Communications
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

### 6. Wire Harness & Installation
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

### 7. Software & Configuration
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

### 8. Documentation & Compliance
- *(Tasks exist in PQS v4 — detailed items TBD from formal doc)*

**Note:** Full task list exists in PQS v4 (75 tasks across 13 sections). The 8 categories above are Nick's reorganization for the practical evaluation. Need to map PQS v4 tasks → these 8 categories.

## Evaluation Model

### Shop-Based (Primary Path)
- Shop designates an authorized evaluator
- Evaluator must complete train-the-trainer qualification
- Evaluator signs off each task as technician demonstrates competency
- All sign-offs tracked in database with evaluator name, date, company
- AEA maintains registry of qualified evaluators

### Alternative Paths
- **AEA HQ Classes** — Instructor signs off tasks covered in class → uploaded to tracker
- **AEA Regional Classes** — Same model (available fall 2026+)
- **OEM Training** (Garmin, Collins, etc.) — Could count toward practical (mapping TBD)
- **Example:** Complete AEA pitot-static class → signed off on pitot-static category

### Rollout Plan (Scott Samuelson's framework)
1. **Phase A:** Perfect at AEA internally (committee beta tests)
2. **Phase B:** Offer at AEA regionals
3. **Phase C:** Shops apply to become authorized evaluation centers

---

## Oral Board
- Rubric-based (existing rubric needs refresh)
- Two committee members per candidate — both must pass
- Done via Zoom, ~1 hour
- Three phases: Portfolio Review → Technical Knowledge → Scenarios
- Candidate submits full package: completed PQS sign-offs, 337 forms, evidence uploads, work samples
- Purpose: catch pencil-whipping on practical tasks
- Danny + committee contributing question bank (in progress)

---

## Evidence & Portfolio
- V1: Photo, video, logbook entry uploads per task
- 337 forms uploadable
- Work completion documentation
- All evidence visible to oral board reviewers
- Full portfolio = everything tracked in the system

---

## Veteran Technician Path (UNRESOLVED)
- Designed for new techs, but need veteran buy-in
- "If you're asking your technicians to get this, you should have it too" — Nick
- Options discussed:
  - Auto-approval for experienced techs / committee members
  - Committee members volunteer as beta testers (Dennis, Jorge, Scott)
  - Abbreviated practical assessment for veterans?
- **Needs formal decision at convention**

---

## Apprenticeship Integration
- CAET and apprenticeship are SEPARATE but complementary
- Tracker could include an **Apprenticeship OJT tab** = Tool 3 from three-tool pipeline
- Most apprenticeship competencies align with CAET
- Gaps: structures, ground ops, engine/power plant, leadership/QA
- If shop is in apprenticeship program, practical tracking could serve both purposes
- **Merit-based certification** (Scott's framing) vs. **hours-based apprenticeship** — different tracks, same tool

---

## Open Design Questions

1. **All tasks or percentage?** — Must candidates complete ALL practical tasks? Some shops lack certain capabilities. (Jorge's concern)
2. **Category vs. task granularity** — Are the 8 categories the sign-off level, or individual tasks within?
3. **Minimum time gap** between CAET base and Advanced? — No hard requirement set. Practical tasks naturally take time.
4. **OEM training mapping** — Which OEM courses count toward which categories?
5. **Demo station requirements** — Jorge suggested shops should have dedicated trainers. Policy?
6. **Evaluator re-qualification** — How often do evaluators need to re-certify?

---

## CAET Advanced Package (Bundled Product — Feb 18)

**Core Insight:** The tracking tool isn't a standalone product. Nobody buys software. They buy a certification path. The tool is how it gets delivered.

### What the Shop Buys (One Price)
- CAET Advanced certification path (Practical → Written → Oral)
- Training content / study materials
- Tracking tool access (PQS progress, evidence uploads, evaluator sign-offs)
- Micro training library (QR-scannable bench reference modules)
- Written exam through USI
- Oral board evaluation

### How It Gets Funded
Shops don't pay out of pocket if they stack correctly:
1. **Funding Finder** → identifies available money (state tax credits, apprenticeship reimbursement)
2. **Apprenticeship pipeline** → DOL/Fastport funds cover RTI training costs
3. **SkillBridge** → military candidates' training is DoD-funded
4. **COOL** → Navy/Marine credentialing funds
5. **State tax credits** → 22 states have workforce training credits

### Three-Tool Pipeline Integration
| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| Funding Finder | Find the money | ✅ BUILT |
| AI Grant Writer | Get the money | Research done |
| CAET Advanced Package | What the money pays for | IN PROGRESS |

## RTI Hour Logging

All training activities must log Related Technical Instruction hours for DOL apprenticeship compliance.

### What Counts as RTI
- CAET study guide modules (self-paced)
- QR micro training modules (video pipeline content)
- AEA HQ classes
- AEA regional classes
- OEM training (Garmin, Collins, etc.)
- Online coursework

### Tracking Requirements
- Time-stamped start/stop per module
- Module completion verification (quiz pass, minimum time threshold)
- Maps to apprenticeship phase (1-4) and competency domain
- Exportable for DOL compliance reporting
- 586 total RTI hours across program (150/150/100/100 + 86 employer-provided)

---

## OJT Hour Tracking

Separate from RTI. On-the-Job Training hours tracked by employer.

### What Gets Tracked
- Hours worked on specific competency areas
- Supervisor attestation
- Competency sign-offs (PQS tasks double as OJT evidence for apprenticeship shops)
- Wage progression documentation

### Integration with PQS
- PQS practical task sign-offs in the tracker serve BOTH purposes:
  - CAET Advanced certification requirement
  - Apprenticeship OJT competency evidence
- One action by the evaluator, two compliance paths satisfied

---

## Micro Training / QR Code System (POST-CONVENTION)

### Concept
QR codes at shop workstations → scan → instant micro training module on phone.

### Content Pipeline
1. Danny (or any shop) shoots short video of bench task
2. AI pipeline: download → transcribe → extract key frames → generate draft module
3. **Nick reviews and approves** (human-in-the-loop, mandatory)
4. Published to training library, QR code generated
5. Module completion logs RTI hours in tracker

### Rules
- Content ONLY from source video — no AI-invented material
- No editorializing on tools, brands, or methods
- AEA cannot endorse specific products or criticize alternatives
- Every module is a DRAFT until Nick approves

---

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 + Supabase + AWS (same as Lineage Hub)
- Supabase Auth (role-based: technician, evaluator, committee, admin)
- Supabase Storage (evidence uploads)
- Supabase DB (candidates, tasks, sign-offs, oral results, evaluator registry)

---

## Convention Deliverable (March 23-26)
**Minimum:** Announce the PATHWAY to CAET Advanced — not just the written test.
- Show the three-phase process (Practical → Written → Oral)
- Show what the practical tasks look like
- Explain how shops become authorized evaluation centers
- Demo the tracking tool (POC or production)
- Committee meeting: formal vote on phase ordering + open questions
